# Firecrawl Skills

A collection of skills for AI coding agents following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format. Available as a plugin for Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenAI Codex.

This repo is the app-integration counterpart to [`firecrawl/cli`](https://github.com/firecrawl/cli).

- Use this repo when an agent is building a product that calls Firecrawl APIs.
- Use `firecrawl/cli` when an agent needs better web access during its own work: search the web, scrape pages, crawl docs, or interact with live sites from the terminal.

## Install

One command installs both the CLI skills and these build skills:

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all --browser
```

Or install just this repo's skills directly:

```bash
npx skills add firecrawl/skills
```

## Available Skills

| [`firecrawl-build-interact`](./skills/firecrawl-build-interact)     | Integrate `/interact` for clicks, forms, and dynamic flows after scrape | Authored here |

## MCP Server

The plugin includes Firecrawl MCP configuration for the official [Firecrawl MCP server](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl-mcp-server), so editors that support bundled MCP metadata can wire Firecrawl tools with `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`.

## Plugins

This repo serves as a plugin for multiple platforms:

- **Claude Code** - `.claude-plugin/`
- **Cursor** - `.cursor-plugin/`
- **OpenAI Codex** - `.codex-plugin/`

## Editing Skills

All current skills in this repo are authored here and can be edited directly in this repo.

If Firecrawl later syncs skills from other repos, that distinction should be documented here and in `AGENTS.md`.

## Prerequisites

- A Firecrawl account or self-hosted Firecrawl deployment
- API key stored in `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` for cloud usage

Get your API key at [firecrawl.dev/app](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app).

If you do not already have an API key, use [`firecrawl-build-onboarding`](./skills/firecrawl-build-onboarding) in this repo. It includes the browser authorization flow directly and does not require the website onboarding skill.

## Relationship To The CLI Repo

Both repos are installed by the same command:

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all --browser
```

This installs the Firecrawl CLI, the CLI skills (for live web work), and these build skills (for app integration) together. The difference is what you use after install:

- **CLI skills** (`firecrawl/cli`) — for searching the web, scraping pages, interacting with live sites during the current session
- **Build skills** (this repo) — for integrating Firecrawl into application code

The build skills here focus on:

- getting an API key into `.env`
- choosing fresh project vs existing project flow
- choosing the right endpoint
- asking what Firecrawl should do in the product
- wiring SDKs or REST calls into code
- inspecting an existing repo before integrating
- running a smoke test so the integration is proven, not just written
- avoiding CLI-only guidance when the real task is product integration

Default build flow:

1. decide whether the project is fresh or existing
2. ask what Firecrawl should do in the product
3. route to `/scrape`, `/search`, or `/interact`
4. integrate using the project's existing conventions
5. verify one real Firecrawl request succeeds

## Source Of Truth

This repo follows the same two usage paths described in Firecrawl's onboarding skill (same install, different use cases):

- Path A: live web tools during the current session (CLI skills)
- Path B: integrate Firecrawl into application code (build skills)

The onboarding source lives at:

- [`firecrawl-web/public/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md`](https://www.firecrawl.dev/agent-onboarding/SKILL.md)

## Scope Boundaries

This repo does not try to duplicate:

- full CLI command references
- terminal flags and output handling rules
- editor setup flows

If a task is "search the web for me right now" or "scrape this URL during the session", use the CLI skills (already installed alongside these build skills).
If a task is "add Firecrawl to this codebase", use the build skills in this repo.

## Notes

- Evals are intentionally deferred in this first pass while the authored skill set settles.
- If the CLI repo grows more integration-focused material, keep that content high-level there and preserve this repo as the detailed implementation home.
