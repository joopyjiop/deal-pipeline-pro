# Firecrawl Workflows

Outcome-focused Firecrawl skills for AI coding agents. These workflows use Firecrawl to produce concrete deliverables such as research reports, SEO audits, QA reports, knowledge bases, lead lists, and agent-ready website design systems.

This repo is the workflow counterpart to the two existing Firecrawl skill segments:

- **Core skills**: live web work with the Firecrawl CLI
- **Build skills**: integrate Firecrawl into application code
- **Workflows**: use Firecrawl to complete repeatable business and creative tasks

## Install

The Firecrawl CLI setup should install all three segments together:

```bash
npx -y firecrawl-cli@latest init --all --browser
```

Or install this workflow pack directly:

```bash
npx skills add firecrawl/firecrawl-workflows
```

## Authoring Principles

Every workflow skill in this repo must:

- stay harness-agnostic; do not name editor-specific APIs such as `AskUserQuestion`
- infer from context first, then ask at most 1-3 blocking onboarding questions only if needed
- target a real user deliverable, not a Firecrawl feature demo
- be structured enough for recurring automation
- call out independently parallelizable work for sub-agents or equivalent parallel task runners
- use Firecrawl through the CLI or the host's equivalent Firecrawl tool surface

## Reference Layouts

This repo takes the useful parts of:

- [`anthropics/skills`](https://github.com/anthropics/skills): simple `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` layout
- [`anthropics/financial-services`](https://github.com/anthropics/financial-services): outcome-focused domain workflows and optional agent packaging
- [`anthropics/claude-for-legal`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-for-legal): verticalized workflows with concrete deliverables

The heavier managed-agent and partner-plugin scaffolding is intentionally omitted until the workflow pack needs it.

## Scope

These skills are for repeatable workflows that use Firecrawl during an agent session. If the task is to add Firecrawl API calls to a product, use the build skills instead. If the task is one-off web access, use the core CLI skills directly.
